# Makefile include file for AArch64 arm_ok. This must be included from the
# top-level Makefile; it is not a standalone Makefile.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Note these variables must only be used in places where Make reads their
# immediate values rather than their deferred values.  This is because all
# the include files use the same variables and the deferred evaluation will
# yeild the last values set by the last include file.  They can be used in the
# target and prerequisite sections of rule definitions, which are evaluated
# immediately, but not in the recipe, where evaluation is deferred.
